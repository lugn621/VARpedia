# Wiki_Speak App!
The Wiki_Speak application creates video files of words you search on Wikipedia, with images from the Flicker API. You can then play your creations through an in-built media player. The application is coded with bash and JavaFX, so it will require the Linux/Unix operating system.   

### Libraries required for the audio functionality are in the repository under the directory lib.  
### Please use the ECSE computer lab Linux image for testing purposes.  

## Here are the directions to easily execute the runnable .jar file provided in the repository.
Step 1: Navigate to the directory of the .jar file, and open a terminal there.  
Step 2: Type into the terminal the following: *java -jar WikiSpeak.jar*  
Step 3: Press enter. The application should now be running. Enjoy!
