# Wiki_Speak
The Wiki_Speak application creates video files of words you search on Wikipedia, with images from the Flicker API. You can then play your creations through an in-built media player. The application is coded with bash and JavaFX, so it will require the Linux/Unix operating system.   

Libraries required for the audio functionality are in the repository under the directory lib.  
Please use the ECSE computer lab Linux image for testing purposes.
